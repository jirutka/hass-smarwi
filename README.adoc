. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new directory called `{proj-name}`.
. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/{proj-name}/` directory (folder) in this repository.
. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
. Restart Home Assistant
. In the HA UI go to “Configuration” -> “Integrations” click “+” and search for “SMARWI”
