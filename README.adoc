= Notice

The component and platforms in this repository are not meant to be used by a user, but as a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù that custom component developers can build upon, to make more awesome stuff.

HAVE FUN! üòé


== Why?

This is simple, by having custom_components look (README + structure) the same it is easier for developers to help each other and for users to start using them.

If you are a developer and you want to add things to this ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù that you think more developers will have use for, please open a PR to add it :)
